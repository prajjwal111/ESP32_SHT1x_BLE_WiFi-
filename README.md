## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to read temperature and humidity values from an SHT1x sensor using an ESP32 and transmit them over BLE. Additionally, it includes functionality to receive WiFi credentials over BLE and connect to a WiFi network.

## Components Required
- ESP32 Development Board
- SHT1x Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- nRF Connect app (or any BLE client)

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the SHT1x sensor to the ESP32 as follows:
- SHT1x Data Pin -> GPIO 4
- SHT1x Clock Pin -> GPIO 5
- SHT1x VCC -> 3.3V
- SHT1x GND -> GND
